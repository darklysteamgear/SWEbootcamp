7.the terminal is the text input/output enviroment, whereas the shell is the actual command line interpreter.
8.absolute path is the path directory you are currently in. the path displayed next to your username in the terminal.
9.the relative path is a path that is deifined to manipulate from the terminal but is not where you are currently executing the command.
10. a flag is an argument you give to a command to modify it's operation. an example would be arp -a, where -a is the flag that will cause arp to list all local ip addresses currently connected to a network. another example with be rm -rf where -rf is the  flag that will cause rm to remove an entire folder (r flag) forcefully (f flag). another example could be ls -l where the l flag will cause ls to list all files in a directory verbosely.
